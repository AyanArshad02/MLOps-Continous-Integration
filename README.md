## ðŸš€ Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions

This repository uses **GitHub Actions** for Continuous Integration (CI). The workflow:
- **Triggers on every push and pull request** to the `main` branch
- **Sets up a Python environment**
- **Installs dependencies**
- **Runs linting (flake8)**
- **Executes unit tests (pytest)**

The following `.yaml` file is located in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml

  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
